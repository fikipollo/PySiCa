# Introduction
PySiCa (_Python Simple Cache_) is a simple cache system implemented for Python applications. 
A cache is a component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.
# Features
PySiCa is entirely implemented in Python and provides the following features:
- Easy to use and to install in your application.
- It does not depend on other libraries or tools.
- Available as a module imported in your application or as a self-contained service accessible through API calls.
- Lightweight module. The code takes less than 300 lines of code.
